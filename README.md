## Game Description

When attempting to make a small loop track, you somehow get stuck within your
own DAW! You have now entered a fast paced, non-stop platformer, with a massive
laser (the play head) chasing you. Run through your own track and try to
activate the different notes to complete the loop! Since itâ€™s a loop, making it
to the end will only send you right back to the start. Now the only escape is to
activate all the instruments in the track!
